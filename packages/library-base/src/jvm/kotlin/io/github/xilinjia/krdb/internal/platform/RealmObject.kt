    // too often, because it's still slow reflection (though less slow than what we're replacing).
    //
    // 3. used `ConcurrentHashMap` because we didn't check this function can never be called
    // concurrently, and if it was, the consequences would be tough, surprising, and hard to
    // diagnose, granted it was a basic (and NOT thread-safe `HashMap`).
    // It's not just about doing the lookup twice, but about infinite loops while iterating, i.e.,
    // tough consequences.
