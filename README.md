### This is a fork and rebranding of [Realm Kotlin](https://github.com/XilinJia/realm-kotlin) which is a fork of the deprecated [Realm Kotlin](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin).  This has been made compatible with Kotlin 2.1+ while updating various dependencies

JVM has been tested to work the same as with builds with Kotlin 2.0.x.  Android, iOS and MacOS has been tested to work.

Unlike the forked repo, this one can be built from source on Linux.

Project structure is changed to make Intellij IDE work.  gradlew needs to be run from the root directory rather than packages.

Testing are performed on the dev versions. Maven artifacts can be published (tested locally), but can not be tested upon yet.

### Version compatibility

krdb 3.2.8 <==> Kotlin 2.2.0

krdb 3.2.6/7 <==> Kotlin 2.1.20

krdb 3.2.5 <==> Kotlin 2.1.10

### Published to Maven Central, how to use:

#### Note, the maven artifacts are built on Linux and lack support for iOS and MacOS, hopefully a github actions can resolve this later

* in project build.gradle, add:
```
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath "io.github.xilinjia.krdb:gradle-plugin:y.y.y"
    }
}
```
and remove:
```
id 'io.realm.kotlin' version 'x.x.x' apply false
```

* in the app build.gradle

in the plugins block, replace:
```id 'io.realm.kotlin' ```
with
```    id 'io.github.xilinjia.krdb' ```

replace:
```implementation "io.realm.kotlin:library-base:x.x.x" ```
with:
```implementation "io.github.xilinjia.krdb:library-base:y.y.y" ```

and replace:
```apply plugin: "io.realm.kotlin" ```
with
```apply plugin: "io.github.xilinjia.krdb" ```

* in all kotlin files, replace "io.realm.kotlin" with "io.github.xilinjia.krdb"
* and of course, change your Kotlin to 2.x.y (refer to Version compatibility)

### To use this with a local build

In addition to the above,

* clone this project with: 
```git clone --recursive https://github.com/XilinJia/krdb.git ```
* build in the project root directory with: 
```
./gradlew clean
./gradlew jvmTest
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal 
```
* in Android project, in settings.gradle at the project level, add in the beginning:
```
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal() // 👈 Add this line
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
* in project build.gradle, add:
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "io.github.xilinjia.krdb:gradle-plugin:y.y.y"
    }
}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
    }
}
```
